# Fight 4 Life
> *There’s no time to waste! With the sun sparing no one and the  unbearable outside air, the Subway is the only safe zone. It seems that other people had the same idea to take shelter here, and now the only way to safely go out is to cooperate and find a way to communicate with the outside world, with... a radio.* </br></br>
*...where ever could it be?*

</br>

#### &emsp; *What game is F4L?*
F4L is a 2D survival indie game where the sun is a deadly laser and 4 characters find themselves in a subway, trying to find safety from the heat. Your job is to keep them alive, rationing all the resources, go to explore outside a station at night and fight if necessary.

</br>

## Ok, but who are you?
<!-- una cosa a metà tra se lo dicessero loro e se lo chiede il narratore (es. il paragrafo della metro sotto) -->

These characters are the main cast of the game and they are:

1. ***Marshall***, the soldier. <br>
He’s a former soldier who continues – with a dejected look on his eyes – to live on even without his loyal tank.
2. ***Vanessa***, the medic. <br>
She a vain medic who brags a lot about her medical degree, to which she took from *5 long years* of medical school, nonetheless she is pretty good with maiming and dissecting.
3. ***Nico Avocado***, the influencer. <br> 
He’s a person full of himself who craves for success, even if it means bringing quarrel inside the group.
4. ***Gino***, the chef. <br>
Not only he’s loved by everyone around him, he’s also a famous chef on television. He became a big-name for his knifes’ collection, and has a strong ability to find the best food for the tastiest meals in the city.

## The Subway – our only shelter

The Subway is a great way to take cover from the sun’s heat, but under there all the food and water are slim to none e all the energy and medications run short very fast.

The group should absolutely partition them with caution; even if their thirst and hunger quickly rise, the **fatigue** of each one of them is affected by the same thirst and hunger, and if someone is too exhausted, their **life will drain**, leading them to death.

Luckily, the subway is operational and in working order, so all people can travel across stations <br>
:warning: *WARNING* :warning: only 4 stations are available, with the 5th unavailable because of `[REDACTED]`. You can send a character to explore the outside of a station, and maybe they will bring something back…

</br>

## We have to find more resources!

The only way to find and gather extra resources is going to **exploration** on nighttime. There are 5 different types of stations, each with their own perks: the **Square**, the **Market**, the **Housing area**, the **Factory** and the **Hospital**. But be careful! <span style="color:blue">With each exploration</span>, the character will return to the subway tired and exhausted.
Every type of station has its own predominant resource:

|       Square       |     Market    | Housing area  |     Factory      |    Hospital    |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| The safest one     | Balanced risk | Balanced risk | Dangerous        | Very dangerous |
| Balanced resources | Food          | Water         | Energy & Weapons | Medicines      |

While a character is out scavenging, they can come across other people, who can or may not be so friendly, and want to engage in a **fight**. The fight consists of a mini-game, the *Mini-g-aim*, where a bar slides back and forth on a meter: the closer to the **center**, the better chances of **winning**.

</br>

## Is there any chance of surviving?

There’s a glimmer of hope in this light-melting calamity, and that’s reaching out the military, they for sure know how to get out of here. We’ll figure out something, but first we have to gather pieces of a radio – **5**, to be sure – and maybe then we’ll have a happy ending.

For sure everyone must not die… or, at least one of us…
