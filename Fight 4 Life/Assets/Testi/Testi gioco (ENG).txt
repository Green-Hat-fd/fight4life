# TESTO IN METRO #
The atmosphere of the subway is very gloomy today, but we have to stay strong if we want to survive and leave this place as soon as possible.
If we will get out of here alive, we should celebrate in that famous place that Niko always told us about... but are we sure it exists?
It would be a nice idea to decorate this place and make it look more hospitable, after all it's gonna be our home for a while.
We wonder how the situation is in other parts of the world, perhaps there are some other survivors just like us.
Vanessa always told us how it would be nice to have a pet here, is it too late for that?
At this point we are only drinking water here, it's a shame that we can't take anything else... something like a nice and fresh lemonade would improve our mood.
Today everyone is incredibly silent and nobody wants to start a conversation, it's almost worse than that day when Niko told Marshall if he wanted to join him in one of his videos once we get out of here.
It would be so nice to recreate one of Gino's recipes, if only we had the right ingredients.


# CIBO #
Behind this drawer there might be something <b>interesting</b>. [/p] decided to check and it looks like someone left his back <b>Food</b> here!<br><br>(You found [/x] food)
It seems that someone left some unopened <b>Food</b> cans here! Surely whoever forgot it here won't miss them.<br><br>(You picked up [/x] food)


# ACQUA #
With this heat, trying to find something to drink is rather difficult... Perhaps that corpse over there with some cat's eyes clothes seems to have some <b>Water</b> bottles with it! And yet the body is all melted... Who knows what ever happened to them...<br><br>(You took [/x] water)
Today might be [/p]'s lucky day! Another handful of survivors decided to give [/p] some <b>Water</b> that they've found. However they didn't define where it's from...<br><br>(You got [/x] water)


# MEDICINE #
[/p] trips on something while walking... By looking into it, it's some <b>Batteries</b>!<br><br>(You fetched [/x] batteries)
Alongside a wall torn down, [/p] sees a clochard near death. He has some <b>Batteries</b> in his hand, and it looks as if he wants to offer them to [/p].<br><br>(You obtained [/x] batteries)


# ENERGIA #
That seems to be an untouched medikit full of <b>Medicines</b>! It's unbelievable how [/p] managed to find one, hopefully they are all not expired.<br><br>(You took [/x] medicines)
There's something beneath this carpet! By taking a better look, [/p] has found some <b>Medicines</b>! The genius who thought hiding them in such a place was a good idea will try harder next time.<br><br>(You picked up [/x] medicines)


# PEZZO DELLA RADIO #
This strange metallic piece reminds [/p] of something, could it be a part of the <b>Radio</b> that will be useful to the team?<br><br>(You found a piece of the radio)
Who would have thought that in a place like this, it would've been possible to find a part of a <b>Radio</b>. Since when the apocalypse started, surprises never end<br><br>(You took a piece of the radio)
A poor boozer gives a strange piece of metal to [/p] which he found on his way and he says that he doesn't need it. By taking a closer look, it looks like a part for crafting the <b>Radio</b>! It's better for [/p] than that buzzed man.<br><br>(You got a piece of the radio)
On this table there's a <b>Radio</b>! [/p] tries to turn it on but it doesn't seem to be working... But wonders, probably some parts may be working.<br><br>(You picked up a piece of the radio)


# COLTELLO TROVATO #
There may have been an underground fighting around here, since [/p] found a bloody <b>Knife</b>. Doesn't seem to be anybody around here with the intent of taking this weapon back... all the better.<br><br>(You found the Knife)
Someone tried to pick this lock with a <b>Knife</b>, although it's enough for [/p], who seems to have found a new weapon to defend themself.<br><br>(You picked up the Knife)


# PISTOLA TROVATA #
There is a corpse of a policeman over here... Nevertheless he has a well loaded <b>Gun</b>! Now it's [/p]'s property.<br><br>(You found the Gun)
There was a gunfight between two gangsters earlier and now they're gone, it's better to pick up this <b>Gun</b> loaded with some bullets and walk away.<br><br>(You picked up the Gun)


# FUCILE TROVATO #
[/p] didn't know that this was a military zone, yet there's no sign of them. The good thing is that [/p] has found a loaded <b>Shotgun</b> rummaging around.<br><br>(You found the Shotgun)
Today might not be [/p]'s birthday, but they've received a nice gift! And it's a nice <b>Shotgun</b> too! Alas the person who had it is now dead, but it would be a shame to leave it here untouched...<br><br>(You found the Shotgun)


# MORTE DEI PERSONAGGI #
It was an honor to meet [/p], yet they didn’t make it.
[/p]’s time is over, may their soul rest in peace.
We did our best for [/p], but it wasn’t enough.
[/p] fought bravely, it’s a shame that they are gone so early.
